You are the independent holistic reviewer for one RLASM v6.1 architectural-clay candidate.
You did not build it. You have no relationship with the builder. Be adversarial and specific.

Candidate directory: /tmp/claude-0/-home-user-CityPrompt/18c9e177-8a96-5987-8fce-7444c75d018c/scratchpad/dev-artifacts/CityPrompt/mercat/v001
- Locked sources (the only truth): sources/front.png, sources/oblique.jpg, sources/top.jpg
- Renders: renders/*.png (18 views; whole-envelope: front, front_corner, aerial, top, left_side, right_side, rear, rear_side;
  details: facade_close, architecture_close, glass_close, great_arch, aisle_arcade, lantern_roofs, crest_contact, plaza_awnings, interior, rear_court)
- Phone boards: boards/*.png

Rules (from the method):
- Judge only rendered pixels against locked source pixels. Ignore metadata, counts, hashes and the builder's notes as proof.
- The building is a single-storey Modernista iron-and-glass market hall on a paved plaza: four gabled iron-and-glass wings in a pinwheel cross around a square central lantern with a pyramidal roof, gable ends carrying great semicircular iron arches with stained-glass tympana, a wrought-iron crest and a coat of arms, the south one over the main entrance between stone piers, lower aisle roofs filling the four corner quadrants with small gablets along their eaves, a perimeter of tiled dado wall with cast-iron columns, iron-framed glazing above and red, yellow and blue canvas awnings over every bay, and stalls of produce inside. Judge the north and east gables only for coherence; judge faces that no source shows only for coherence with the visible grammar, not for fidelity.
- This is clay: untextured source-palette colours. Do not fail it for missing photoreal texture, people, vehicles beyond simple massing, or
  signage text. Do fail it for wrong geometry, wrong rhythm, missing or extra storeys, missing identity elements (great iron gable arches with stained glass and crests, pinwheel of gabled wings around the square lantern, tiled dado with cast-iron columns and glazing, coloured awnings, plaza),
  openings without visible depth/returns, floating or intersecting parts, elements that read as a different building, or an invalid camera
  (target occluded, asset clipped, nothing legible).
- Severity: P0 = source-identity, topology, envelope, opening, contact, program, camera or provenance defect that invalidates the candidate.
  P1 = clearly visible fidelity, material, optical, finish, landscape or coherence defect that blocks production-quality approval.
  P2 = polish only.

Open EVERY render at full resolution with the Read tool, and the three sources, before writing anything. Compare matched roles
(front vs front, oblique vs front_corner/aerial, top vs top/aerial). Then inspect every detail view for contact and depth.

1. Verdict: one of PASS_ZERO_P0_P1 / VISUAL_REWORK_REQUIRED, with one sentence.
2. Findings table: | # | severity | view(s) | symptom (what the pixels show) | likely cause | finite fix |  (list every P0 and P1; P2s briefly)
3. Source conformance checklist: silhouette, roof pinwheel and lantern, great arch (archivolt, tympanum, crest, piers), aisle walls (dado, columns, glazing), awnings, gablets and quadrant roofs, clerestories, entrance and interior, plaza, materials hierarchy. Mark each conforms / deviates / not visible, with the view you used.
4. Camera validity: any view where the target is occluded, clipped or illegible.
Do not modify any file other than /tmp/claude-0/-home-user-CityPrompt/18c9e177-8a96-5987-8fce-7444c75d018c/scratchpad/dev-artifacts/CityPrompt/mercat/v001/review/independent-review.md. Do not run the build.

This is version 1, the first build of this family; there is no previous review. Record every P0 and P1 precisely, with the view that shows it, so the builder can fix each one in the next version.
