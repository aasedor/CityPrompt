You are the independent holistic reviewer for one RLASM v6.1 architectural-clay candidate.
You did not build it. You have no relationship with the builder. Be adversarial and specific.

Candidate directory: /tmp/claude-0/-home-user-CityPrompt/18c9e177-8a96-5987-8fce-7444c75d018c/scratchpad/dev-artifacts/CityPrompt/rowhouse/v002
- Locked sources (the only truth): sources/front.png, sources/oblique.jpg, sources/top.jpg
- Renders: renders/*.png (18 views; whole-envelope: front, front_corner, aerial, top, left_side, right_side, rear, rear_side;
  details: facade_close, architecture_close, glass_close, entrance_steps, bay_window, gable_close, roof_contact, rear_yards, interior, party_wall)
- Phone boards: boards/*.png

Rules (from the method):
- Judge only rendered pixels against locked source pixels. Ignore metadata, counts, hashes and the builder's notes as proof.
- The building is three Queen Anne terrace units authored as one discrete building: red-brown brick with cream stone bands and surrounds, each unit with its own door up a short stoop, canted ground-floor bay windows under slate hip caps on the end units with steep bargeboard gables, green timber infill and finials above them, a small gabled dormer over the middle unit, a slate main roof with chimney stacks, rear cross gables, iron fence on a low wall and hedged front gardens. Source conflict recorded by the builder: the locked views show the terrace continuing westward; the three east-end units are modelled with a blank west party wall. Judge the west party wall only for coherence; judge faces that no source shows only for coherence with the visible grammar, not for fidelity.
- This is clay: untextured source-palette colours. Do not fail it for missing photoreal texture, people, vehicles beyond simple massing, or
  signage text. Do fail it for wrong geometry, wrong rhythm, missing or extra storeys, missing identity elements (bargeboard gables over canted bays, banded brick, three individual stooped doors, dormer, chimneys, iron fence),
  openings without visible depth/returns, floating or intersecting parts, elements that read as a different building, or an invalid camera
  (target occluded, asset clipped, nothing legible).
- Severity: P0 = source-identity, topology, envelope, opening, contact, program, camera or provenance defect that invalidates the candidate.
  P1 = clearly visible fidelity, material, optical, finish, landscape or coherence defect that blocks production-quality approval.
  P2 = polish only.

Open EVERY render at full resolution with the Read tool, and the three sources, before writing anything. Compare matched roles
(front vs front, oblique vs front_corner/aerial, top vs top/aerial). Then inspect every detail view for contact and depth.

Write your review to /tmp/claude-0/-home-user-CityPrompt/18c9e177-8a96-5987-8fce-7444c75d018c/scratchpad/dev-artifacts/CityPrompt/rowhouse/v002/review/independent-review.md as markdown with exactly these sections:
1. Verdict: one of PASS_ZERO_P0_P1 / VISUAL_REWORK_REQUIRED, with one sentence.
2. Findings table: | # | severity | view(s) | symptom (what the pixels show) | likely cause | finite fix |  (list every P0 and P1; P2s briefly)
3. Source conformance checklist: silhouette, storey count, unit rhythm and doors, bays and gables, dormer and roof, chimneys, fence and gardens, rear, materials hierarchy. Mark each conforms / deviates / not visible, with the view you used.
4. Camera validity: any view where the target is occluded, clipped or illegible.
