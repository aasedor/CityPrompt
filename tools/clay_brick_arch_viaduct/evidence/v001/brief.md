You are the independent holistic reviewer for one RLASM v6.1 architectural-clay candidate.
You did not build it. You have no relationship with the builder. Be adversarial and specific.

Candidate directory: /tmp/claude-0/-home-user-CityPrompt/18c9e177-8a96-5987-8fce-7444c75d018c/scratchpad/dev-artifacts/CityPrompt/viad/v001
- Locked sources (the only truth): sources/front.png, sources/oblique.jpg, sources/top.jpg
- Renders: renders/*.png (18 views; whole-envelope: front, front_corner, aerial, top, left_side, right_side, rear, rear_side;
  details: facade_close, architecture_close, glass_close, arch_shopfront, pier_pilasters, track_ballast, parapet_coping, train_cars, cobbled_street, rear_north)
- Phone boards: boards/*.png

Rules (from the method):
- Judge only rendered pixels against locked source pixels. Ignore metadata, counts, hashes and the builder's notes as proof.
- The building is a Victorian brick rail viaduct (the top view governs the plan): a long straight run of semicircular brick arches on massive piers with pilasters and stone imposts, the arches infilled with glazed shopfronts and timber frames, a parapet with coping, two ballasted tracks on top with a red-and-white train, a cobbled street and pavement along one side, brick terrace houses with slate roofs as context. a bridge (a street or path option, not a building): judge span form, structure, deck, edges, supports, contact with banks and ground, and pedestrian-scale finish, not storeys; the surrounding city is simplified context; judge faces that no source shows only for coherence with the visible grammar, not for fidelity.
- This is clay: untextured source-palette colours. Do not fail it for missing photoreal texture, people, vehicles beyond simple massing, or
  signage text. Do fail it for wrong geometry, wrong rhythm, missing or extra storeys, missing identity elements (long brick arch viaduct with pilastered piers, glazed shopfronts in the arches, coped parapet, twin tracks and a train on top, cobbled street alongside),
  openings without visible depth/returns, floating or intersecting parts, elements that read as a different building, or an invalid camera
  (target occluded, asset clipped, nothing legible).
- Severity: P0 = source-identity, topology, envelope, opening, contact, program, camera or provenance defect that invalidates the candidate.
  P1 = clearly visible fidelity, material, optical, finish, landscape or coherence defect that blocks production-quality approval.
  P2 = polish only.

Open EVERY render at full resolution with the Read tool, and the three sources, before writing anything. Compare matched roles
(front vs front, oblique vs front_corner/aerial, top vs top/aerial). Then inspect every detail view for contact and depth.

Write your review to /tmp/claude-0/-home-user-CityPrompt/18c9e177-8a96-5987-8fce-7444c75d018c/scratchpad/dev-artifacts/CityPrompt/viad/v001/review/independent-review.md as markdown with exactly these sections:
1. Verdict: one of PASS_ZERO_P0_P1 / VISUAL_REWORK_REQUIRED, with one sentence.
2. Findings table: | # | severity | view(s) | symptom (what the pixels show) | likely cause | finite fix |  (list every P0 and P1; P2s briefly)
3. Source conformance checklist: plan and proportions, arch count and rhythm, piers and pilasters, imposts and arch rings, shopfront infill (glazing, frames, signs), parapet and coping, track deck (ballast, rails, sleepers), train, cobbled street and pavement, context terraces, materials hierarchy. Mark each conforms / deviates / not visible, with the view you used.
4. Camera validity: any view where the target is occluded, clipped or illegible.
Do not modify any file other than /tmp/claude-0/-home-user-CityPrompt/18c9e177-8a96-5987-8fce-7444c75d018c/scratchpad/dev-artifacts/CityPrompt/viad/v001/review/independent-review.md. Do not run the build.
This is version 1, the first build of this family; there is no previous review. Record every P0 and P1 precisely, with the view that shows it, so the builder can fix each one in the next version.
